[Gitlepy](https://github.com/DavidRambo/gitlepy) is a very simple version-control package written in Python and inspired by git.
I made it because I wanted to learn how to use the [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) library for the CLI as well as to practice test-driven development using [Pytest](https://pytest.org).
It is a reimplementation of a Java implementation called [Gitlet](https://github.com/DavidRambo/cs61b-sp21/tree/main/proj2), which was an assignment in previous semesters of UC Berkeley's CS 61B.
